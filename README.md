Description
Bug World is a JavaFX-based simulation game that models a simplistic ecosystem involving bugs and plants. In this virtual world, bugs wander around a field containing various plants, including flowers, grass, and trees. The bugs can eat the plants to gain energy, which affects their size and energy levels. The game provides interactive controls for pausing and resuming the simulation, adding new plants.

Features
Dynamic Ecosystem Simulation: Watch as bugs move around the environment, interacting with plants.
Interactive Controls: Start, pause, and resume the simulation at any time.
Add Plants: Dynamically add flowers, grass, or trees to the ecosystem.
Energy System: Bugs consume energy as they move and gain energy by eating plants.
Growth and Shrinkage: Plants grow over time, and bugs grow as they consume plants. Plants shrink when eaten by bugs.
